While other DTG printers require frequent maintenance, the Ri 1000 saves time by automating white ink agitation, self-cleaning functions, and continuous monitoring of ink supply and air levels. For maintenance functions that are not automated, the Ri 1000â€™s built-in Interactive Operation Guide alerts users, sending them reminders to complete necessary tasks. The result is a printer that is low-maintenance and ready to print at any time.",
